# Boyer-Moore
an implementation of Boyer-Moore algorithm
 
```
you can include bm.h and use class Boyer-Moore like this:

#include "bm.h"

boyerMoore bm(pattern);

bm.bmC(text)

bmC will retrun true if text and pattern is matched

```

# simple benchmark

we run 10000urls to compare with linux grep,
out algorithm make a littler faster than linux grep
